\arguments{
\item{nT}{A vector of the number of tagged individuals for each
tagging effort.}

\item{n_c1}{(optional) A vector of the number of tagged individuals
in one of two categorical variables. If this is not being
used then n_c1 will be equal to nT.}

\item{TaL}{A vector of the cumulative number of tagged individuals
following each effort.}

\item{c}{One value for the total number of tagging efforts.This
value must be greater than or equal to 6.}

\item{R}{A vector of the number of recaptured individuals per
effort.}

\item{err}{A value (between 1 and 26) that represents the weekly
mortality rate and weekly tag loss rate from a preloaded
case study listed in the metadata. Alternatively, model
coefficients can be manually included using a combination
of the preceding parameters. While the preloaded data are
based on weekly time stamps, customized model
coefficients can reflect any time period specified and
the projection will predict loss at 5 times the time
interval.

This returns a dataframe \code{datacomp} that contains summary
information from each mark-recapture effort, several parameters
used in the calculation of adjusted recaptures, and basic error

\description{
This model estimates the percent loss in tagged animals at large for
field-based recapture studies based on a linear decrease in survival and tag
retention (including lost tags and missidentified tags) for five weeks per
tagging cohort based on laboratory retention/survival studies. The
\code{retentionmort()} function can be used following a recapture field study to
estimate user-based tag loss in animals at large. The model is changed by
linear regression coefficients of weekly tag loss rate, weekly mortality
rate, and their respective intercepts. The coefficients used can be selected
from the currently included list using the \code{err} input or be customized.
This function is also capable of working with a cofactor with two conditions
(e.g. class1 individuals and large individuals) to improve resolution for
more specified studies.
